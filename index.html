            <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Justin</span></h1>
            <p> I'm an a Second Year Electrical and Computer Engineer at Santa Clara University. 
                I have a lot of technical experience working with AWS Services and various AI models. 
                In addition, I have hackathon experience where I was able to combine my strong academic skills 
                along with my leadership to lead an entire project. Through clubs like Formula SAE and AI Collaborate,
                and organizations like Boy Scouts and GLIFY, I'm able to combine both my passion for engineering and 
                the environment. In the future, I aim to be in a long-term development team, working to create technological 
                advancements.
